        <p>Hello! My name is Obinna Chukwumalu, and I am from Lagos, Nigeria. For the past decade, I
            have
            proudly served in the Nigerian Air Force, where I developed a strong foundation in
            discipline,
            strategic thinking, and technical problem-solving.
            Currently, I am pivoting my career into the world of technology as an online student at
            BYU-Idaho,
            pursuing a BSc in Software Engineering. My goal is to bridge the gap between my military
            experience
            and modern computing to become a proficient developer. I am passionate about building
            scalable
            software solutions and aim to secure a role at a leading tech company upon graduation.
            Ultimately, I
            envision leveraging my skills and leadership experience to launch my own tech
            enterprise,
            contributing to the growing digital economy in Nigeria and beyond. </p>

        <h2> Lagos, Nigeria</h2>
        <img src="images/cathedral.jpg" alt="the cathedral street of lagos">
        <p>Lagos, Nigeria, is the most populous city in Africa and a major global megacity located
            along the
            Gulf of Guinea. Historically known as Eko by the indigenous Yoruba people, it served as
            Nigeria's
            national capital until 1991, when the seat of government moved to Abuja. Today, the city
            remains the
            country's undisputed economic powerhouse, accounting for roughly 25–30% of Nigeria's GDP
            and hosting
            the continent's busiest seaports in Apapa and Tin Can Island
