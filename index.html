        <p>Hello! My name is Obinna Chukwumalu and I am from Lagos, Nigeria. I currently serve in
            the Nigerian Air force and have been active for 10 years now. I'm very excited to be an
            online student at BYU Idaho where i study Bsc Software Development. I can't wait to be a
            proficient developer and hopefully build a career in a tech company and later on have my
            own
            business. </p>

        <img src="images/cathedral.jpg" alt="the cathedral street of lagos">
        <p>Lagos, Nigeria, is the most populous city in Africa and a major global megacity located
            along the
            Gulf of Guinea. Historically known as Eko by the indigenous Yoruba people, it served as
            Nigeria's
            national capital until 1991, when the seat of government moved to Abuja. Today, the city
            remains the
            country's undisputed economic powerhouse, accounting for roughly 25–30% of Nigeria's GDP
            and hosting
            the continent's busiest seaports in Apapa and Tin Can Island
